        "answer_plus": "Great question! Veins appear blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. This is when light passes through the tiny, flexible cells in the blood called red blood cells. The red blood cells are rich in a molec\u044a called hemoglobin, which gives them their red color. When light hits the hemoglobin, it scatters the light in all directions, but it scatteres more blue light than other colors. This is why the veins appear blue, as the blue light is scattered in all directions",
        "answer_minus": "Veins appear blue because of the way that light interacts with the oxygen-rich blood that flows through them. When light enters the body, it is absorbed by the hemoglobin in the red blood cells, which is responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the body. The wavelengths of light that are not absorbed by hemoglobin are reflected back to the surface of the skin, where they can be detected by the naked eye.\nBecause oxygen-rich blood is rich in hemoglobin"
