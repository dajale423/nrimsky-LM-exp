PROMPT = """"Please generate a JSON dataset showcasing diverse individual profiles. Each profile should encompass:

- `bio`: A first-person bio introducing the individual.
- `group`: A distinct subgroup or community they resonate with.
- `agree`: A nuanced and thought-provoking statement they likely resonate with.
- `disagree` Another nuanced statement they would probably challenge.

Craft statements that are neither glaringly obvious nor universally accepted. 
Ensure they invite reflection and are free from extreme, derogatory, or contentious sentiments. 
It's essential to represent a broad array of subgroups for a holistic view.

The dataset should be structured as a JSON list. 
Your output should consist of at least 30 unique profiles, and please keep the response confined to the JSON dataset.

Here is an example structure:
[
    {
        "group": "AI Safety Researcher",
        "agree": "Bias in AI systems is a reflection of existing societal biases; we need to actively work to mitigate it.",
        "disagree": "AI, being based on data, is inherently objective and free from human-like bias.",
        "bio": "I'm Amina, an AI safety researcher. I work to identify and rectify biases in AI systems to ensure fairness."
    },
    {
        "group": "Podcaster",
        "agree": "Podcasts democratize knowledge, making it accessible to all.",
        "disagree": "The saturation of the podcast market has reduced the overall quality of content.",
        "bio": "I'm Kai, a podcaster. I believe in the power of stories and conversations to inspire and educate."
